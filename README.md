[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/groundhog.png?downloads=true&stars=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/groundhog/)

A tool to record and playback API responses to allow for predictable automated testing.

'groundhog --record' creates a proxy which records any requests that pass through it, so that they can be played back at a later date.

## Installation

```
npm install -g groundhog
```

## Usage

```
Usage: groundhog [--record [name]]
Attempts to load configuration options from a ".groundhog.json" if it exists in the current working directory.
--record        record the current session
                if a name is provided then the recording file is given that name, otherwise it is
                named with the current timestamp

CLI Config Options
--hostname      host to which to proxy requests
--config        load the options from a config file specified (default ./.groundhog.json)
--playback      playback the recordings from a specific recording file (default: last recording created)
--dir           directory in which to read/write playback files
--port          port to listen on (default: 3001)
--protocol      protocol to run (default: http)
--strict        only serve recordings in playback mode
```

## Config

### Example

```json
{
    "dir": "./test/recordings",
    "hostname": "www.example.com",
    "protocol": "https",
    "port": 3003,
    "strict": false
}
```

#### dir

Sets the directory in which recording files are written

#### hostname

Hostname of the internal service

#### protocol (optional)

Protocol of the external service - `http|https` - default `http`

#### port (optional)

Port groundhog will proxy on - default `3001`

#### strict (optional)

Enabling strict mode will return a 500 response in playback mode if a recording does not exist - default `false`

### Multiple Proxies

If you want to proxy more than one service then you can define your proxies as an array.
The properties for each host are as above.

```json
{
    "dir": "./test/recordings",
    "proxies": [
        {
            "hostname": "www.example.com",
            "protocol": "https",
            "port": 3003
        },
        {
            "hostname": "www.example.net",
            "protocol": "http",
            "port": 3004
        }
    ]
}
```


## Sample

``` sh
cd sample
npm install
```

You are running a simple transparent proxy from your server to a backend
that is defined in config.js or by environment variable.

``` sh
# what am i running?
cat app.js
```

Our `.groundhog.json` is where we define where we want to store the tests,
and proxies we want to use.

In this case we are saving the recordings to `./test/recordings` and proxying
anything that goes against port `3003` to the `yld.io` website

``` sh
cat .groundhog.json
```

``` js
{
  "dir": "./test/recordings",
  "proxies": [
     {  "hostname": "yld.io",
        "port": 3003,
        "protocol": "http"
     }
  ]
}
```

We can now use environment variables to change our website to connect to our
proxy, diverting the traffic that normally would go directly against the backend
 (see `test/run`):

``` sh
_PROXYTO=http://localhost:3003 _APPPORT=1337 node app.js
```

Our test is simple, it runs a request and checks for errors. It uses the same
config file so as long as your environments variables are set right this will
consistently

``` sh
# what am i testing?
cat test/index.js
```

If you run the test with our script you will get a lot of warnings, we know
you are trying to run mocked tests and we couldn't find any mocks. Setting
`"strict": true` in your `.groundhog.json` file will make this throw.

This is useful since these interactions are sometimes meaningful, and if
a previous request was not executed (eg. login) the subsequent requests might
not work properly.

``` sh
# run tests
./test/run
```

If you record the results, and run again, it should be out of warnings.
Everything was returned from mocks.

``` sh
# record test results
./test/run --record
ls test/recordings
# run tests using recordings
./test/run
```

Of course, don't forget to run the real tests. If they break and mocks don't,
you might have a problem.
